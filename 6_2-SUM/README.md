The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm.

The file "algo1-programming_prob-2sum.txt" contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the
row of the file specifying the i-th entry of the array.

The task is to compute the number of target values "t" in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.
