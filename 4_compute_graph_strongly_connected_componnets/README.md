The file "SCC.txt" contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head (recall the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex). So for example, the row looks liks : "2 47646". This just means that the vertex with label 2 has an outgoing edge to the vertex with label 47646

The task is to code up the algorithm for computing strongly connected components (SCCs), and to run this algorithm on the given graph.

WARNING: This is the most challenging programming assignment of the course. Because of the size of the graph you may have to manage memory carefully. The best way to do this depends on your programming language and environment, and we strongly suggest that you exchange tips for doing this on the discussion forums.
